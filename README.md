## Description
The Task Manager application was created as a demonstration of the skills and methods I've been acquiring to build a backend for a website. With this application, users can write down various tasks that they'd like to carry out and then delete those tasks once they're complete. Tasks/notes are saved to a database from which they can then also be retrieved and/or deleted at anytime. The Task Manager has a simple JavaScript, CSS, and HTML front end and on the backend uses various technologies such as Express.js, Heroku, and NPM packages such as FS, UUID, and Router.
